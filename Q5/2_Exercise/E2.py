# > Question 5 Exercise 2
#
# > Description:
#         You have a N x N chessboard with K rooks. You want to find the number of sqaures
#     on the chessboard that are not attacked by a rook. A rook will attack any sqaure that
#     is on the same column or same row.

# > Input Specification:
#         The first two lines will contain integers N and K. Then, there will be K lines of
#     two integers separated by a single space, which are the X and Y coordinate of the rook
#     (1-indexed). You may assume no two rooks occupies the same sqaure.
#     1 <= N <= 1,000,000
#     1 <= X, Y <= N
#     0 <= K <= 100
#     for 50% of the points: 1 <= N <= 1,000
#
# > Output Specification:
#         Output will be an integer representing the number of sqaures that are not attacked.
#
# > Sample Input 1:
#     8
#     2
#     3 3
#     4 4
#
# > Sample Ouput 1:
#     36
#
# > Sample Input 2:
#     8
#     2
#     1 2
#     1 5
#
# > Sample Output 2:
#     42
