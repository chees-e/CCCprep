# > Question 5 Exercise 1
#
# > Description:
#         You are being placed in a M by N maze with obstacles. You start at the top left
#     corner (1, 1) and you want to get to bottom right corner (M, N). You employ the following
#     strategy: for every move you first choose direction (up, down, left right), then keep
#     going straight in that direction until you hit a obstacle or a wall, then repeat the
#     process by choosing a new direction. Determine whether or not you are able to get to the
#     goal by following this strategy.
#
#     Bonus 1: Determine the minimum number of moves required to reach the goal.
#     Bonus 2: Determine the type of moves required to reach the goal.
#
# > Input Specification:
#         The first two lines will contain integers M and N. Then, there will be M lines of
#     string of length N representing the maze. Obstacles will be represented by the
#     character "X" while empty spaces will be presented by the character ".". You may assume
#     (1, 1) and (M, N) are never "X".
#     2 <= M, N <= 500
#     0 <= obstacles <= M * N - 2
#
# > Output Specification:
#         Output will be one line of True / False which indicates whether or not you can
#     reach the goal.
#
# > Sample Input 1:
#     3
#     4
#     ..X.
#     ...X
#     X...
#
# > Sample Ouput 1:
#     True
#
# > Sample Input 2:
#     4
#     4
#     ..X.
#     ....
#     ....
#     ..X.
#
# > Sample Output 2:
#     False
