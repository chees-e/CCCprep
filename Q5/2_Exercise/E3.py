# > Question 5 Exercise 3
#
# > Description:
#         You wrote a bunch of integers on a sheet of paper but your little brother has added
#     a random digit between every adjacent pairs of numbers resulting in a long string of
#     digits. You do not remember the original list of numbers but you do know that their sum
#     is K. Knowning that, print out the original list of numbers. Numbers must not contain
#     leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, you can print out any valid answer.
#
# > Input Specification:
#         There will be one line of string of digits as input.
#     1 <= length of input <= 30
#     1 <= K <= 1,000,000
#
# > Output Specification:
#         First line of output will be the integer K, the second line of output will be
#     a list of numbers separated by spaces.
#
# > Sample Input 1:
#     67
#     3752812
#
# > Sample Ouput 1:
#     37 28 2
#     Also valid: 3 52 12
#
# > Sample Input 2:
#     25
#     123456789
#
# > Sample Output 2:
