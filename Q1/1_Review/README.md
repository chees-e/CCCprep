# Question 1

### Essential Skills:

- Arithmetic Operations
- Logical expressions 
- if / elif / else statements

### Tips:

- The first question tend to be short and simple, don't spend too much time on it.
- Becuase numbers are usually involved, `int(input())` is most likely required to convert the input into an integer.
