#     Given N cupcakes and K students, determine the minimum number of of cupcakes each
#     student is going to get if cupcakes are distributed in a way that the highest and
#     lowest number of cupcakes given to any student differs by at most 1. Also determine
#     if it is possible for all students to get the same number of cupcakes with no   
#     leftovers.
#
# > Input Specification:
#         Input will be two lines. First line will contain the integer N, the second line
#     will contain the integer K.
#     1 <= N <= 1,000,000
#     0 <= K <= 1,000
#
# > Output Specification:
#         Output will be two lines. First line will contain the integer equal to the 
#     minimum number of cupcakes any student can get, second line will contain 
#     True / False equal to whether if all students can get the same number of cupcakes.
