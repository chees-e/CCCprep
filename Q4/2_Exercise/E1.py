#         You want to attend the most popular party in the city. In order to achieve your 
#     goal, you asked your friends to monitor the activity at each party and send you 
#     reports. A report has the following format: X people entered party ID, or, X people 
#     left party ID. Given a list of reports, determine the party ID with the most number 
#     of people, as well as how many people are present at the end of the report. Assume #       all party start with 0 people.
