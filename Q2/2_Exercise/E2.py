# > Question 2 & 3 Exercise 2
#
# > Description:
#         One day, a group of N friends tried an experiment where they each paid for another
#     person's groceries. Given N integers representing the cost of each person's groceries,
#     determine the number of people who paid more for the other person's groceries than if
#     they only paid for their own.
#
#
# > Input Specification:
#         The first line of input will contain an integer N. There will be N lines of input
#     following the first. Each line will contain an integer equal to a person's grocery
#     cost. The person at line i will pay for the person at i+1's groceries, with the last
#     person paying for the first person's groceries.
#     1 <= N <= 100
#     1 <= price <= 1,000
#
# > Output Specification:
#         Output will be one line with an integer equal to the number of people who spent
#     more money due to the experiment.
