# Question 2 & 3

### Essential Skills:

- Loops
- Input
- String operations
- Coordinates

### Tips:

- The second question usually involves a variable number of inputs. This is usually done in two ways:
  1. First input takes a number N that represents the number of inputs after. (for loop)
  2. Keep taking inputs until a stopping keyword (while loop)
- It is also very common to have multiple inputs on the same line, in which case you will need to use the `.split()` function to separate the strings.
- You will often need to make a few variables in order to solve the problems, think carefully about the information you need to remember.
- String decoding problems are becoming somewhat popular for question 2 & 3. Do go over the examples we covered in class.
- Make best use of the visuals!
