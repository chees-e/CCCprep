### General Tips
- Use sample input/output to test all your solutions
- Break the questions down first before writing
- Try to get partial marks if the question is too hard
- Read the problem description, input/output specifications very carefully
- Pay attention to the data type you are working with, use appropriate conversions when needed
  - `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
  - you can also use `list(map(int, lst))` to convert a list of strings into list of integers
- look out for index out of range errors, think about this when you define the loop parameters
